# Token Bucket and Distributed Token Bucket â€“ README  

## Overview  

The Token Bucket algorithm is a traffic-shaping mechanism used to control data transmission rates in applications. It allows bursts of data while maintaining an average flow rate, making it ideal for systems where sudden spikes in requests are expected.  

## Key Concepts  

- **Bucket Capacity:** The maximum number of tokens the bucket can hold, defining the burst allowance.  
- **Burst Rate:** The immediate maximum capacity for requests when the bucket is full.  
- **Refill Rate:** The rate at which tokens are replenished over time, defining the average sustainable rate of requests.  
- **Tokens:** Units that represent permission to process requests.  

## How It Works  

1. Tokens are added to the bucket at a constant refill rate until the bucket is full.  
2. When a request is made, it consumes one or more tokens depending on the resource requirements.  
3. If there are no tokens available, the request is either delayed or rejected, depending on implementation.  
4. Burst rate allows processing of requests above the steady refill rate up to the bucket capacity.  

## Distributed Token Bucket  

In distributed systems, multiple nodes may need coordinated rate limiting. A distributed token bucket system synchronizes token consumption across nodes to ensure that global rate limits are enforced.  

### Key Components  

- **Centralized State:** Shared storage or communication between nodes to maintain the bucket state.  
- **Consistency Protocols:** Mechanisms (e.g., leader election, distributed locks) to maintain consistent token usage.  
- **Fault Tolerance:** Mechanisms to handle node failures and maintain system availability.  

### Best Practices for Distributed Token Bucket  

1. **Synchronization:** Use efficient synchronization methods (such as Redis or Zookeeper) to minimize latency.  
2. **Clock Drift Management:** Ensure all nodes maintain consistent timing to avoid refill inconsistencies.  
3. **Fallback Mechanism:** Provide a strategy for graceful degradation when the synchronization service is unavailable.  

## Use Cases  

- API rate limiting to prevent abuse.  
- Bandwidth management in networks.  
- Throttling requests to backend services.  

This implementation helps balance performance, scalability, and fairness by accommodating bursts while enforcing steady consumption limits.
