# Why web sockets, when we have SSEs? 

---

### **Why SSEs Are Great**
1. **Simple to Implement:** Built into modern browsers via `EventSource`; no special libraries required.
2. **One-Way Communication:** Ideal for pushing updates (like live scores, stock prices) from server to client.
3. **Text-Based:** SSE uses simple, lightweight text-based protocols (HTTP).
4. **Auto-Reconnect:** Automatic reconnection and event handling for free.
5. **Efficient:** Works over HTTP/1.1 and reuses existing connections, which can reduce overhead.

### **Why Use WebSockets (When SSEs Fall Short)**
1. **Bidirectional Communication:**  
   - WebSockets allow real-time two-way communication, perfect for chat apps, collaborative editing tools, and interactive games.
   - SSEs are strictly server-to-client.

2. **Binary Data Support:**  
   - WebSockets can transmit both text and binary data efficiently (great for multimedia, images, and sensor data).
   - SSEs are limited to text-only payloads.

3. **High Message Volume:**  
   - WebSockets typically handle large volumes of data better in scenarios where messages need to be sent frequently in both directions.

4. **Network Compatibility (HTTP/2 and Beyond):**  
   - WebSockets are fully compatible with modern network protocols and provide persistent full-duplex communication.

5. **Control over Connection Lifecycle:**  
   - WebSockets give developers more granular control over connections (ping/pong messages, etc.).

### **Summary**
If your requirement is **simple, text-based, one-way real-time updates** (like your Kafka-driven score updates), **SSE is perfect**. However, if you need **bidirectional communication**, multimedia support, or more control over messaging, **WebSockets are better**.

# Why stateful? 

Why cant it do like SSE? client can publish to server upon reconnect, and server vice versa

That's a solid thought! In theory, **WebSockets could work like SSE with reconnections**, but it would introduce complexities and performance inefficiencies. Let me explain why WebSockets are designed to be stateful rather than stateless like SSE.

---

### **Why Not Stateless WebSockets?**
1. **Reconnection Overhead:**  
   When a client disconnects from WebSockets, if it reconnects and needs to "publish" all missing context (like chat room details or game state), it would:
   - Increase network usage to sync back the entire state.  
   - Slow down real-time interactions (every reconnection is essentially a "mini-reset").  

   In SSE, only the server needs to replay events, and the client passively consumes them.

2. **Frequent Two-Way Syncing:**  
   SSE is one-way, so only the server broadcasts events, and reconnections handle just **client data fetching**. But WebSockets are **bidirectional**:
   - Imagine a multiplayer game — players continuously send and receive thousands of events per second.  
   - Upon every disconnection, both sides would need to sync their entire game state to keep playing.

3. **Complexity for Use Cases with Constant State Updates:**  
   In chat apps or games:
   - Reconnecting with context (like room participants, missed messages, active tasks) requires keeping event logs or snapshots.  
   - This complexity doesn’t arise naturally in SSE because SSE doesn't maintain an interactive context.

---

### **Real-World Example Comparison**
- **Chat App over SSE:** Only the server streams messages. If the client reconnects, it fetches missed messages using the `Last-Event-ID`.  
- **Chat App over WebSockets:** Both the client and server talk continuously — typing notifications, message receipts, presence updates. After a disconnect:
  - Who was typing?  
  - What messages were delivered or read?  
  - What is the current conversation status?  

---

### **TL;DR**
WebSockets are stateful because they need to **remember a continuous conversation between the client and server**, not just "shout" messages like SSE does. Making WebSockets stateless would slow things down and add unnecessary complexity for real-time use cases like chats or multiplayer games.
