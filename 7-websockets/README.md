# Why web sockets, when we have SSEs? 

---

### **Why SSEs Are Great**
1. **Simple to Implement:** Built into modern browsers via `EventSource`; no special libraries required.
2. **One-Way Communication:** Ideal for pushing updates (like live scores, stock prices) from server to client.
3. **Text-Based:** SSE uses simple, lightweight text-based protocols (HTTP).
4. **Auto-Reconnect:** Automatic reconnection and event handling for free.
5. **Efficient:** Works over HTTP/1.1 and reuses existing connections, which can reduce overhead.

---

### **Why Use WebSockets (When SSEs Fall Short)**
1. **Bidirectional Communication:**  
   - WebSockets allow real-time two-way communication, perfect for chat apps, collaborative editing tools, and interactive games.
   - SSEs are strictly server-to-client.

2. **Binary Data Support:**  
   - WebSockets can transmit both text and binary data efficiently (great for multimedia, images, and sensor data).
   - SSEs are limited to text-only payloads.

3. **High Message Volume:**  
   - WebSockets typically handle large volumes of data better in scenarios where messages need to be sent frequently in both directions.

4. **Network Compatibility (HTTP/2 and Beyond):**  
   - WebSockets are fully compatible with modern network protocols and provide persistent full-duplex communication.

5. **Control over Connection Lifecycle:**  
   - WebSockets give developers more granular control over connections (ping/pong messages, etc.).

### **Summary**
If your requirement is **simple, text-based, one-way real-time updates** (like your Kafka-driven score updates), **SSE is perfect**. However, if you need **bidirectional communication**, multimedia support, or more control over messaging, **WebSockets are better**.

# Why stateful? 

Why cant it do like SSE? client can publish to server upon reconnect, and server vice versa

That's a solid thought! In theory, **WebSockets could work like SSE with reconnections**, but it would introduce complexities and performance inefficiencies. Let me explain why WebSockets are designed to be stateful rather than stateless like SSE.

---

### **Why Not Stateless WebSockets?**
1. **Reconnection Overhead:**  
   When a client disconnects from WebSockets, if it reconnects and needs to "publish" all missing context (like chat room details or game state), it would:
   - Increase network usage to sync back the entire state.  
   - Slow down real-time interactions (every reconnection is essentially a "mini-reset").  

   In SSE, only the server needs to replay events, and the client passively consumes them.

2. **Frequent Two-Way Syncing:**  
   SSE is one-way, so only the server broadcasts events, and reconnections handle just **client data fetching**. But WebSockets are **bidirectional**:
   - Imagine a multiplayer game — players continuously send and receive thousands of events per second.  
   - Upon every disconnection, both sides would need to sync their entire game state to keep playing.

3. **Complexity for Use Cases with Constant State Updates:**  
   In chat apps or games:
   - Reconnecting with context (like room participants, missed messages, active tasks) requires keeping event logs or snapshots.  
   - This complexity doesn’t arise naturally in SSE because SSE doesn't maintain an interactive context.

---

### **Real-World Example Comparison**
- **Chat App over SSE:** Only the server streams messages. If the client reconnects, it fetches missed messages using the `Last-Event-ID`.  
- **Chat App over WebSockets:** Both the client and server talk continuously — typing notifications, message receipts, presence updates. After a disconnect:
  - Who was typing?  
  - What messages were delivered or read?  
  - What is the current conversation status?  

---

### **TL;DR**
WebSockets are stateful because they need to **remember a continuous conversation between the client and server**, not just "shout" messages like SSE does. Making WebSockets stateless would slow things down and add unnecessary complexity for real-time use cases like chats or multiplayer games.

### Components

1. **Client Devices:** Connect via WebSocket for real-time chat communication.
2. **Load Balancer:** Distributes client requests to available WebSocket servers.
3. **WebSocket Servers (Clustered):** Manage persistent client connections and handle incoming/outgoing chat messages.
4. **Kafka:** Persistent backbone for message storage and reliable delivery.
5. **Kafka Streams Application:** Listens to Kafka, filters messages based on `chat_id`, and publishes relevant messages to Redis Pub/Sub.
6. **Redis Pub/Sub:** Dynamic routing for real-time chat delivery to WebSocket servers.
7. **Database/Cache:** Stores persistent chat history and other user metadata.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Kafka Setup
1. Install and configure Kafka:
    ```bash
    brew install kafka
    zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
    kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
    ```

2. Create a Kafka topic for chat messages:
    ```bash
    kafka-topics.sh --create --topic chat-messages \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 10 --replication-factor 1
    ```

3. Partitioning Strategy:
    - Messages for each chat room are assigned to a partition using a hash function:
      ```python
      partition = hash(chat_id) % num_partitions
      ```

4. Message Structure:
    ```json
    {
      "chat_id": "chat-room-123",
      "sender": "Alice",
      "message": "Hello, Bob!",
      "timestamp": "2025-02-03T12:00:00Z"
    }
    ```

### 2. Redis Pub/Sub Setup
1. Install Redis:
    ```bash
    brew install redis
    redis-server
    ```

2. Example Redis Pub/Sub Publisher:
    ```python
    import redis

    redis_client = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)
    chat_channel = 'chat-room-123'

    redis_client.publish(chat_channel, "Hello, Bob!")
    ```

3. Example Redis Pub/Sub Subscriber:
    ```python
    import redis

    redis_client = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)
    pubsub = redis_client.pubsub()

    pubsub.subscribe('chat-room-123')

    for message in pubsub.listen():
        if message['type'] == 'message':
            print(f"Received: {message['data'].decode('utf-8')}")
    ```

### 3. Kafka Streams Application for Filtering and Redis Publishing

1. Set up Kafka Streams to filter messages based on `chat_id` and publish them to Redis Pub/Sub.

2. Example Kafka Streams filtering and publishing application:
    ```python
    from kafka import KafkaConsumer
    import redis

    kafka_consumer = KafkaConsumer(
        'chat-messages',
        bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
        key_deserializer=lambda k: k.decode('utf-8'),
        value_deserializer=lambda v: v.decode('utf-8')
    )

    redis_client = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)

    for message in kafka_consumer:
        chat_id = message.key
        chat_message = message.value
        redis_client.publish(chat_id, chat_message)
    ```

3. Kafka Streams ensures that only relevant chat messages are forwarded to Redis for efficient real-time delivery.

### 4. WebSocket Server Integration

1. Example WebSocket server that subscribes to Redis channels and sends messages to connected clients:
    ```python
    import websockets
    import asyncio
    import redis

    async def chat_handler(websocket, path):
        redis_client = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)
        pubsub = redis_client.pubsub()

        chat_room = await websocket.recv()  # Chat room ID from the client
        pubsub.subscribe(chat_room)

        async for message in pubsub.listen():
            if message['type'] == 'message':
                await websocket.send(message['data'].decode('utf-8'))

    start_server = websockets.serve(chat_handler, "localhost", 8765)

    asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(start_server)
    asyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever()
    ```

### 5. Database Storage
1. Store chat messages for history and analytics in a database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL).
2. Use asynchronous background tasks to persist Kafka messages.

### 6. Load Balancer Configuration
1. Use an NGINX configuration for WebSocket load balancing:
    ```nginx
    http {
        upstream websocket_backend {
            server ws1.example.com;
            server ws2.example.com;
        }

        server {
            location /chat {
                proxy_pass http://websocket_backend;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
            }
        }
    }
    ```

---

## Key Benefits
1. **Scalability:** Kafka ensures high-throughput persistent messaging.
2. **Real-Time Communication:** Redis Pub/Sub enables dynamic key-based subscriptions for fast message delivery.
3. **Fault Tolerance:** Kafka and Redis together provide resilience to server failures.
4. **Efficient Resource Usage:** Avoids creating millions of Kafka topics; leverages partitioning and dynamic Redis channels.
