# Password Hashing and Verification

`store_and_check_passwords.py` script demonstrates how to securely hash and verify passwords using the `bcrypt` library.

## Functions

- **hash_password(plain_password):**  
  Hashes a plain text password using bcrypt and returns the hashed password.

- **check_password(plain_password, hashed_password):**  
  Verifies if the provided plain text password matches the hashed password.

## Usage

1. The script stores a hashed password in a simulated database (`database`).
2. It checks if the plain text password matches the stored hashed password.

## Example

```python
user_name = 'danny'
plain_password = 'Abc$123'

database[user_name] = hash_password(plain_password)
print(check_password(plain_password, database[user_name]))
```

The script will print `True` if the password matches, otherwise `False`.

## Requirements

- `bcrypt` library

You can install it using:

```bash
pip install bcrypt
```

# JWT Authentication: Exchanging Password for Access and Refresh Tokens

THe  `user_registration_api.py` and `user_login_api.py` how the JWT-based authentication system works by exchanging a user's password for an **access token** and a **refresh token**. It also details how these tokens are used to access protected routes and refresh the session.

## Overview

- **Access Token:** A short-lived token used for authentication to access protected resources.
- **Refresh Token:** A long-lived token used to obtain a new access token after the current one expires.

### Flow:

1. **Login:** 
   - A user submits their username and password to the `/login` endpoint.
   - If the credentials are valid, an **access token** and a **refresh token** are generated and returned.
   
2. **Accessing Protected Routes:**
   - The **access token** is used to authenticate requests to protected routes, which are accessible using the `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header.

3. **Refreshing Access Token:**
   - After the access token expires, the user can use the **refresh token** at the `/refresh` endpoint to request a new access token without needing to log in again.

---

## API Endpoints

### 1. `/login` (POST)

- **Purpose:** Authenticates the user and provides an **access token** and **refresh token**.
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "username": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password"
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "access_token": "your_access_token",
    "refresh_token": "your_refresh_token"
  }
  ```
- **Description:** 
   - The server checks if the provided username and password are valid.
   - If successful, the server responds with a new **access token** and **refresh token**.
   - Access tokens are typically short-lived (e.g., 15 minutes), while refresh tokens are long-lived (e.g., 30 days).

### 2. `/refresh` (POST)

- **Purpose:** Uses the **refresh token** to obtain a new **access token**.
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "refresh_token": "your_refresh_token"
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "access_token": "new_access_token"
  }
  ```
- **Description:**
  - This endpoint is used when the **access token** expires.
  - The client sends the **refresh token** to request a new **access token**.
  - The **refresh token** must be valid and fresh (not expired).
  
---

## How Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens are Used

### Access Token:

- **What it is:** A short-lived token (e.g., 15 minutes) used to access protected routes.
- **How to use it:** 
  - The client includes the **access token** in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.
  - Example header:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
    ```

- **Expiration:** Once expired, the client must request a new **access token** using the **refresh token**.

### Refresh Token:

- **What it is:** A long-lived token (e.g., 30 days) used to obtain a new **access token** when the current one expires.
- **How to use it:** 
  - The client sends the **refresh token** to the `/refresh` endpoint to get a new **access token**.
  - The **refresh token** should be securely stored as it can be used to refresh the session.

- **Expiration:** Refresh tokens have a longer lifespan than access tokens, but they will eventually expire. If expired, the user will need to log in again.

---

## Example Usage

### Login:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "danny", "password": "Abc$123"}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "your_access_token",
  "refresh_token": "your_refresh_token"
}
```

### Accessing Protected Route:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/protected \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token"
```

### Refreshing Access Token:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/refresh \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"refresh_token": "your_refresh_token"}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "new_access_token"
}
```

---

## Security Considerations

- **Secure Storage:** Always store **refresh tokens** securely (e.g., in an HttpOnly cookie or a secure storage solution). Avoid storing them in localStorage.
- **Token Expiry:** Access tokens should have a short expiration time (e.g., 15 minutes) to limit exposure. Refresh tokens have a longer expiration (e.g., 30 days) but should still be protected.
- **JWT Secret:** Ensure that the `JWT_SECRET_KEY` is kept secure and not exposed in the codebase. Itâ€™s used to sign and verify the tokens.

---

## Requirements

- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install flask flask-jwt-extended
  ```

# Secure Cookie Implementation with Flask

`set_secure_cookie.py` demonstrates how to set a secure cookie in Flask using SSL encryption. It also covers the importance of using `HttpOnly` cookies and CORS settings for security.

## Setting a Secure Cookie

In this example, we set a cookie called `session_token` with the following attributes:

- **secure**: Ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS connections, preventing interception over HTTP.
- **httponly**: Prevents JavaScript access to the cookie, reducing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **samesite**: Limits the cookie's scope to same-site requests or top-level navigation, mitigating the risk of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **domain**: Specifies the domain for which the cookie is valid. In this case, it is set to `abc.yourdomain.com`.
- **path**: Defines the URL path for which the cookie is valid, set to `/` here for the entire site.

### Example Code:

```python
from flask import Flask, make_response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/set_secure_cookie')
def set_secure_cookie():
    resp = make_response("Cookie is set")
    resp.set_cookie(
        'session_token', 'abc123',
        secure=True,        # Only sent over HTTPS
        httponly=True,      # Not accessible via JavaScript
        samesite='Lax',     # Sent on same-site requests and top-level navigation from external sites
        domain='abc.yourdomain.com',  # Specify the domain
        path='/'           # Specify the path
    )
    return resp

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(ssl_context=('/path/to/server.crt', '/path/to/server.key'))
```

## Important Cookie Attributes

### `HttpOnly`
The `HttpOnly` flag ensures that the cookie is not accessible via JavaScript. This is important for preventing malicious JavaScript code (in case of an XSS attack) from accessing sensitive cookies, such as session identifiers.

### `CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)`
CORS settings determine whether a browser should allow cross-origin requests. When setting cookies, it's important to ensure that the server supports CORS and only allows trusted origins to access the cookies.

For example, if your front-end and back-end are hosted on different domains, you will need to configure CORS to allow cookies to be sent and received across these domains. Flask can manage CORS using the `flask-cors` extension.

**Basic CORS Setup:**
```bash
pip install flask-cors
```

```python
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app, supports_credentials=True)  # Allows cookies to be sent with cross-origin requests
```

### Why CORS and HttpOnly Matter:
1. **HttpOnly Cookies**: Protect sensitive session data by making it inaccessible to client-side JavaScript, reducing the risk of XSS attacks.
2. **CORS**: Prevents unauthorized domains from making requests to your API. Always restrict cross-origin requests to trusted origins.

## Running the Application

To run the application:

1. Ensure that you have generated an SSL certificate (`server.crt`) and private key (`server.key`).
2. Run the Flask application with SSL:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Access the `/set_secure_cookie` endpoint using a browser or Postman with `https://localhost:5000/set_secure_cookie`.

## **Overview**:
OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows clients to verify the identity of an end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server and obtain basic profile information about the end-user.

### **Key Features**:
- **Authentication**: Provides authentication to applications (clients).
- **Profile Information**: Allows applications to obtain basic user profile information.
- **REST-like**: Operates in an interoperable, RESTful manner.

---

## **1. Purpose**:
- **Authentication**: OIDC provides authentication services to applications, allowing them to verify user identities.
- **Profile Information**: It also facilitates the sharing of basic user profile information with applications.

---

## **2. Built on OAuth 2.0**:
- **OAuth 2.0**: OAuth 2.0 is primarily designed for authorization (granting access).
- **OIDC Extension**: OIDC builds upon OAuth 2.0 by adding identity verification and user information retrieval, effectively extending OAuth's capabilities.

---

## **3. Key Components**:
- **ID Token**: A JSON Web Token (JWT) containing the user's identity information.
- **UserInfo Endpoint**: An endpoint that allows applications to retrieve additional user information.
- **Scopes & Claims**: A standard set of scopes (e.g., `openid`, `profile`) and claims (user data) used to define the user information provided.

---

## **4. Single Sign-On (SSO)**:
- OIDC enables **Single Sign-On** (SSO), allowing users to authenticate once and access multiple applications without needing to log in again.

---

## **5. Decentralized**:
- OIDC supports **multiple identity providers**, meaning a user can authenticate using different identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).

---

## **6. Wide Adoption**:
- OIDC is widely adopted and supported by major identity providers such as:
   - **Google**
   - **Microsoft**
   - **Apple**
   - and many others.

---

## **Practical Use Case**:
- A user can authenticate with an identity provider (e.g., Google) and then use that authentication to access various services from different applications without needing separate credentials for each service.

---

## **Benefits for Developers**:
- **Simplified Authentication**: Developers can delegate the authentication process to trusted identity providers (such as Google or Microsoft).
- **Standardized Information**: OIDC provides a standardized approach to obtaining verified user information through the ID token and UserInfo endpoint, simplifying secure authentication implementation.

------------------------

Here are structured notes on **Authorization**:

---

# **Authorization**

**Authorization** is the process of determining whether a user, system, or entity has the right to access a resource or perform a specific action. It takes place **after authentication**, which verifies the identity of the entity, and focuses on **what actions the authenticated entity is permitted to perform**.

### **Key Concepts**:

1. **Access Control**:
   - Authorization is a **core component** of access control systems.
   - It defines and enforces the rules that govern **who can access resources** and what **actions** they can perform on those resources.

2. **Principle of Least Privilege**:
   - Users should only have the **minimum levels of access** necessary to perform their tasks, reducing the risk of accidental or malicious misuse of resources.

3. **Separation of Duties**:
   - For **critical operations**, authorization may require approval from **multiple parties** to prevent abuse and ensure checks and balances.

---

## **Types of Authorization Models**:

### 1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Access rights are **associated with roles**, and users are assigned to these roles.
   - Example: A user with the role of **"Editor"** might have permissions to **edit and publish content** but not modify system settings.

### 2. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**:
   - Access decisions are based on the **attributes** of the user, resource, and environment.
   - Example: A user from the **"HR department"** may have access to certain files, but only during **working hours**.

### 3. **Rule-Based Access Control**:
   - Access is determined by a set of **rules and policies**.
   - Example: **Firewall rules** that allow or deny network access based on IP addresses or protocols.

---

## **Implementation in Systems**:

### 1. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**:
   - Lists of permissions attached to **objects** (files, directories, etc.).
   - Example: **File system permissions** defining who can read, write, or execute a file.

### 2. **Capability-Based Security**:
   - **Possession of a capability token** grants access rights.
   - Example: **OAuth tokens** that grant access to specific APIs or services.

### 3. **Policy-Based Access Control**:
   - Access is determined by **policies** based on the **attributes** of the subject (user) and object (resource).
   - Example: **AWS IAM policies** to define user permissions for accessing cloud resources.

---

### **Importance of Authorization**:
- Authorization ensures that only **authorized users or systems** can perform sensitive actions, protecting resources and data from unauthorized access.
- It is often implemented alongside **authentication** to create a **secure system**.

Here are structured notes on **OAuth 2.0 (Open Authorization 2.0)**:

---

# **OAuth 2.0 (Open Authorization 2.0)**

OAuth 2.0 is a framework that enables third-party applications to access a user's resources without exposing the user's credentials. It delegates access and authorization tasks to a trusted authorization server.

---

## **1. Core Components**:
- **Resource Owner**: The user who owns the data and authorizes access to it.
- **Client**: The application requesting access to the user's data.
- **Authorization Server**: Issues access tokens to the client upon successful authorization.
- **Resource Server**: Hosts the protected resources/data the client wants to access.
- **Access Token**: A credential used by the client to access protected resources.
- **Refresh Token**: Used by the client to obtain new access tokens when they expire.

---

## **2. Key Features**:
- **Delegated Authorization**: OAuth allows a user to grant permission to a third-party application to access their resources without sharing their credentials.
- **Token-based Authentication**: OAuth uses tokens (access and refresh tokens) for secure communication.
- **Separation of Authentication and Authorization**: OAuth separates the process of verifying identity (authentication) from the process of granting access (authorization).
- **Multiple Grant Types**: OAuth supports several grant types to accommodate different authorization flows (e.g., authorization code, client credentials).
- **Scoped Access**: OAuth allows fine-grained control over what resources a client can access through the use of scopes.

---

## **3. Technical Implementation**:
1. **Client Registration**: The client (application) registers with the authorization server.
2. **Authorization Request**: The client asks the resource owner for permission to access their resources.
3. **Authorization Grant**: The resource owner provides authorization to the client (e.g., through consent).
4. **Access Token Request**: The client sends the authorization grant to the authorization server to request an access token.
5. **Access Token Issuance**: The authorization server issues an access token to the client.
6. **Accessing Protected Resources**: The client uses the access token to make requests to the resource server for protected data.

---

## **4. Example Access Token (JWT format)**:
```json
{
  "iss": "https://authorization-server.com",
  "sub": "user123",
  "aud": "client_id",
  "exp": 1516239022,
  "scope": "read write"
}
```

---

## **5. Pros**:
- **Widely adopted industry standard**: OAuth is used by many popular services (e.g., Google, Facebook).
- **Supports various client types**: OAuth works with web, mobile, and desktop applications.
- **Fine-grained access control**: OAuth allows precise control over what resources are accessible via **scopes**.
- **Secure third-party access**: OAuth enables safe third-party access to resources without sharing user credentials.

---

## **6. Cons**:
- **Complexity**: OAuth's implementation and understanding can be complex.
- **Security risks**: If not implemented properly, OAuth can be vulnerable to attacks.
- **Token management**: OAuth requires careful handling of access and refresh tokens to ensure security.

---

## **7. Best Suited For**:
- **API Authorization**: OAuth is ideal for scenarios where third-party apps need to access APIs on behalf of a user.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: OAuth can be used to allow users to log in once and access multiple services.
- **Delegated Access**: OAuth is perfect for scenarios like "Login with Google" where users authorize access to their data for third-party services.
- **Microservices Architectures**: OAuth facilitates secure, token-based communication between microservices.

---

## **8. Common Grant Types**:
1. **Authorization Code**: For server-side applications where the client can securely store the authorization code.
2. **Implicit**: For client-side applications, though considered less secure and deprecated in favor of Authorization Code with PKCE.
3. **Resource Owner Password Credentials**: For trusted first-party clients, where the user directly provides their credentials.
4. **Client Credentials**: For application-to-application authentication, typically used for machine-to-machine communication.

---

## **9. Security Considerations**:
- **Always use HTTPS**: Secure communication is essential to protect sensitive data.
- **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)**: PKCE enhances security for public clients (e.g., mobile apps).
- **Proper Token Handling**: Always validate and handle tokens carefully, ensuring they are not exposed or misused.
- **Short-lived Access Tokens**: Access tokens should be short-lived, with refresh tokens used to obtain new ones to reduce the risk of abuse.

----

# Role based access control, attribute based access control

Here are the notes with markdown formatting:

---

# **Simple Attribute-Based Access Control**

## **Authentication and Authorization Separation**:
- **Authentication** is handled by the JWT system using the `@jwt_required()` decorator.
- **Authorization** (role-based access) is handled by the `business_owner_required` decorator.

## **Role Assignment**:
```python
/register
    role = request.json.get('role', 'user')  # Default role is 'user'
    users[username] = {
        'password': hashed_password,
        'role': role
    }
```

## **Role Checking**:
The `business_owner_required` decorator implements role-based access control:
```python
def business_owner_required(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated_function(*args, kwargs):
        current_user = get_jwt_identity()
        if current_user not in users or users[current_user]['role'] != 'business_owner':
            return jsonify(message="Business owner access required"), 403
        return f(*args, kwargs)
    return decorated_function
```

```python
@app.route('/business', methods=['POST'])
@jwt_required()
@business_owner_required
def add_business():
    # ...
```

This ensures that only users with the `'business_owner'` role can add, update, or delete businesses.

---

# **AWS IAM for Role-Based Access Control**

## **1. Core Components**:
- **API Gateway**: Configurable to use IAM for authorization.
- **IAM Roles**: Define permissions for different API users.
- **IAM Policies**: Specify allowed/denied actions on API endpoints.
- **AWS Signature V4**: Used to sign API requests with IAM credentials (temporary credentials).

## **2. Key Features**:
- Fine-grained access control at the API method level.
- Temporary credentials for clients via role assumption.
- Integration with Cognito for user identity management.

## **3. Technical Implementation**:
- Configure **API Gateway** with IAM authorization.
- Create **IAM roles** with specific API permissions.
- Attach **policies** to roles, defining access to API resources.
- Use **AWS SDKs** or **Cognito** for role assumption in your app.
- Implement **AWS Signature V4** for API requests.

## **4. Example IAM Policy**:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": ["execute-api:Invoke"],
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:execute-api:region:account-id:api-id/stage/GET/products",
    "arn:aws:execute-api:region:account-id:api-id/stage/POST/orders"
  ]
}
```

## **5. Pros**:
- Centralized management within the AWS ecosystem.
- Scalable and secure.
- Detailed audit logs.

## **6. Cons**:
- AWS-specific solution (potential lock-in).
- Complexity in setup and client-side implementation.
- Potential latency increase.

## **7. Best Suited For**:
- **AWS-centric architectures**.
- Requirements for **fine-grained access control**.
- Teams familiar with **AWS services**.

This approach leverages **AWS's robust IAM system** for API authorization, offering powerful access control but with the trade-off of being tightly coupled to the AWS ecosystem.

# JSON Web Tokens (JWT)  

## Introduction  
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, self-contained token format used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. The information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

---

## Structure of a JWT  
A JWT consists of three parts separated by dots (`.`):
```
<Header>.<Payload>.<Signature>
```

### 1. **Header**  
Contains metadata about the token, such as the type (`JWT`) and the signing algorithm.

**Example**:
```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

### 2. **Payload**  
Contains claims, which are statements about an entity (typically the user) and additional data.

**Example**:
```json
{
  "sub": "user123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "iat": 1516239022,
  "exp": 1516246222
}
```

### 3. **Signature**  
Verifies the authenticity of the token and ensures data integrity.

**Generated using**:
```
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
```

---

## How JWT Works  

1. **User Authentication:**  
   The client sends credentials to an authorization server for authentication.  

2. **Token Generation:**  
   If authentication is successful, the server responds with a JWT.  

3. **Token Usage:**  
   The client includes the JWT in the request headers (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`) to access protected resources.  

4. **Token Validation:**  
   The server validates the JWT signature and expiration before granting access to the resource.  

---

## Benefits of JWT  
- **Compact Format:** Ideal for HTTP headers.  
- **Self-Contained:** Holds all the necessary information for verification.  
- **Stateless:** No need to store session data on the server.  

---

## Example HTTP Request with JWT  
```
GET /protected-resource HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

---

## Security Considerations  
1. **Use HTTPS:** Always transmit JWTs over secure channels.  
2. **Short-Lived Tokens:** Use expiration (`exp`) claims.  
3. **Signature Validation:** Always validate the token's signature.  
4. **Avoid Storing Sensitive Data:** JWT payload is not encrypted, only encoded.

# Encryption at Rest with Keymaster & Encryption in Transit Using HTTPS  

## Introduction  
Data security is essential for modern applications. Two important practices include:  
- **Encryption at Rest:** Protecting stored data from unauthorized access.  
- **Encryption in Transit:** Securing data as it moves between systems.  

This document explains how to implement encryption at rest using **Keymaster** and encryption in transit using **HTTPS**.

## 1. Encryption at Rest Using Keymaster  

### What is Keymaster?  
Keymaster is a key management system that provides secure storage and handling of cryptographic keys. It simplifies encrypting sensitive data at rest, such as files or database records.

### How It Works  
- Keys are generated and securely stored within Keymaster.  
- Applications request encryption keys for encrypting and decrypting data.  
- The encrypted data is stored in databases or file systems.  

### Implementation Steps  
1. **Set Up Keymaster:**  
   - Configure your application to integrate with Keymaster for key retrieval.  

2. **Encrypt Data:**  
   - Use the retrieved encryption key to encrypt sensitive data before storage.  

3. **Store Encrypted Data:**  
   - Store the encrypted payload in your database or file system.  

4. **Decrypt Data:**  
   - When accessing data, retrieve the key and decrypt the data as needed.  

### Best Practices  
- Rotate encryption keys periodically.  
- Use separate keys for different data types.  
- Monitor key access for anomalies.

## 2. Encryption in Transit Using HTTPS  

### What is HTTPS?  
HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) encrypts data communication between clients and servers using TLS (Transport Layer Security). This ensures confidentiality and data integrity during transmission.

### How It Works  
- TLS/SSL certificates encrypt the communication channel.  
- The client and server perform a handshake to establish a secure connection.  
- Data exchanged during the session is encrypted.

### Implementation Steps  
1. **Obtain an SSL/TLS Certificate:**  
   - Purchase or generate a certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA).  
   - For development, use tools like Letâ€™s Encrypt for free certificates.  

2. **Configure the Server:**  
   - Install the certificate and configure the server to use HTTPS.  
   - Update your web server configuration (`Nginx`, `Apache`, etc.) accordingly.

3. **Redirect Traffic:**  
   - Force all traffic to use HTTPS by redirecting HTTP to HTTPS.

4. **Client-Side Verification:**  
   - Ensure your client applications trust the CA and verify the server certificate.

### Best Practices  
- Use strong ciphers and protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher).  
- Regularly renew and rotate certificates.  
- Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security).  
- Monitor for certificate expiration.

## Security Considerations  
- **Encryption at Rest:** Ensure that Keymaster keys are properly protected and access controlled.  
- **Encryption in Transit:** Always monitor and test the security configuration of your HTTPS endpoints.  
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Combine both approaches to secure data comprehensively.  

By using Keymaster for encryption at rest and HTTPS for encryption in transit, your application can achieve a high level of data security while meeting regulatory and industry compliance requirements.
